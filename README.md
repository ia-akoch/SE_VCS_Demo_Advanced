## Part 1 - Containerized Deployments: Tips and Best Practices
### Persisting files to version control?
We've talked previously about only using version control on the files you care about. This could be projects, config, or both. With a containerized environment we have the choice of what files to persist to the host file system vs in a Docker named volume. What we prefer to version control can also help us decide what files we want to persist.
If you want both projects and config items and are using containerization fro your deployment, only persist the data/projects and data/config/resources directories to the host file system. Them create the local repo on a folder where both of those are persisted. You may even get into more infrastructure related items you would like to version control, like a Docker Compose file, or other environmental defining files.

Share Ignition service in docker-compose.yaml file. Show how volumes are configured.
```
      - ign-demo-vcs-modes-data:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data
      - ign-demo-vcs-modes-resources:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/config/resources
      - ign-demo-vcs-modes-projects:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/projects
```
ign-demo-vcs-modes-data:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data - This line persists the entire data directory in a Docker named volume. It will keep not only the entire config and projects, but other "local only" files that hold things like the UUID and certs that make this gateway an unique instance from the others using the same remotes repo.

ign-demo-vcs-modes-resources:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/config/resources - This line persists out config/resources directory to the host file system, allowing that to be controlled in a local git repo. It contains all of the gateway configuration items across all deployment modes.

ign-demo-vcs-modes-projects:/usr/local/bin/ignition/data/projects - This line perists the projects directoy to the host file system, alloring that to be controlled in a local git repo. It contains all of the project resources on the gateway.


### Potential Permission issues when persisting both Docker named volumes and bind mounts
As discussed before, it can be beneficial to only track the directories you want with your vcs efforts. However, if you are using a deployment method like Docker and persisting just the projects and/or config directory you may notice that the gateway itself will lose all the local files that make it a unique deployment(Things like the UUID and certs) whenever you re-spin up that gateway. You can persist the entirety of the data directory in a Docker named volume alongside the specific directories that are persisted to the host file system. Doing this can cause potential permission issues, as the container user that is creating the volumes may not have access to create the needed files on the host system. To allow this to run you can start the container with user: 0:0 to run as root. We also recommend supplying the IGNITION_UID and IGNITION_GID for security reasons to run the Ignition service in the container as a specifically created application service account.


### .env file
the .env file holds environmental variables for the docker-compose file. This allows us to keep all these variables for determining how the gateway is spun up in one spot. It also keeps us form needing to edit the docker-compose file. There are 2 notable things about the .env file in this demo that can be good practice.
1. The .env file has been added to the .gitignore file. This keeps the different environment variables for separate environments out of the tracked files.

2. We do track a .env.example file, that provides anyone spinning up a new environment with our stack to have a template .env file to start out with.

Looking at the .env file we can see a new variable for deployment mode. This will allow us to pass the deployment mode through our docker image environment variable and not have to touch the ignition.conf file, since we aren't persisting that to the host anymore!


## Part 2 - Tags and Releases
### What are they and why?
Whenever your repo hits a state that you want to promote to production, it can be a good time to create a release. A release is a distinct version of the repo at a certain point in time. They are created based on tags, which are added to commits. Because of this it can be a good idea to add a tag to any commit that you may want to push to a QA/test environment.

### Let's create a release!
